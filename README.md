# Ubikwitus
Ubikwitus is a tool designed to make predictions on the biological activity of potential cancer drug candidates.

## Description
Ubiquitin Carboxyl-Terminal Hydrolase L1 is a protein linked to the formation of Parkinson's disease (Olga Et, Al 2024) and some forms of breast Cancer (Milon et al., 2022). This protein proves to be a potential drug target and prompts the study of biological activity. Ubikwitus is a regression model trained on over seventy thousand pubchem molecular fingerprint data to predict the bioactivity of inhibitor molecules within that region. All molecular data was assembled from the ChemBL database and thoroughly cleaned by Arnold and me before training and testing. You will find our model evaluations in the main branch of the repo

## Getting Started
You will find our model evaluations in the main branch of the repo
To interact with the model and screen your drug target, use the streamlit new_app.py within the master branch in tandem with all the other files within that branch.
